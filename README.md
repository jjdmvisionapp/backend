Backend for the project, contact Josh if you have any issues.

Run `jjdmvision.py` to start the server.
## Required Packages:
- email_validator
- flask
- flask-session
- pytest

You should be able to use the miniconda environment given to get all these.

You can do that by running `conda env create --file environment.yml` once you have miniconda installed.
Periodically, run `conda env update --file environment.yml --prune` to get new packages if we get more (I'll lyk if that happens)
